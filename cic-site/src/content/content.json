Not only did we help a group of wonderful people learn new skills to be able to advance their careers in a growing field, but we also learned a lot about how each of us could grow and contribute in more meaningful ways in the future of this program as well. There was a wealth of data collected that will positively influence future cohorts, allowing this program to evolve organically along with the wants and needs of both this area and in the technology field in general. I am so grateful to be a part of this endeavor, and am looking forward to seeing if this program will continue.",
